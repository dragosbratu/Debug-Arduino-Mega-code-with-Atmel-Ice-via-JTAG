Name,Pin,Description,Arduino Mega Pin, ICSP Pin
TCK,1,Test Clock (clock signal from the Atmel-ICE into the target device),A4,3
TMS,5,Test Mode Select (control signal from the Atmel-ICE into the target device).,A5,the 5th wire (stripped one)
TDI,9,Test Data In (data transmitted from the Atmel-ICE into the target device).,A7,4
TDO,3,Test Data Out (data transmitted from the target device into the Atmel-ICE).,A6,1
nTRST,8,Test Reset (optional, only on some AVR devices). Used to reset the JTAG TAP controller.
nSRST,6,Reset (optional). Used to reset the target device. Connecting this pin is recommended since it allows the Atmel-ICE to hold the target device in a reset state, which can be essential to debugging in certain scenarios.
VTG,4,Target voltage reference. The Atmel-ICE samples the target voltage on this pin in order to power the level converters correctly. The Atmel-ICE draws less than 3mA from this pin in debugWIRE mode and less than 1mA in other modes.,5V,2
GND,2,10,Ground. Both must be connected to ensure that the Atmel-ICE and the target device share the same ground reference.,GND,6
